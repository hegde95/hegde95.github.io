- title: HyperPPO- A scalable method for finding small policies for robotic control
  publishedIn:

  paper:
    summary:  We propose HyperPPO, an on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that utilizes graph hypernetworks to estimate the weights of multiple neural architectures simultaneously. Our method estimates weights for networks that are much smaller than those in common-use networks yet encode highly performant policies. We obtain multiple trained policies at the same time while maintaining sample efficiency and provide the user the choice of picking a network architecture that satisfies their computational constraints.

  paper:
    summary:  In this work, we propose using diffusion models to distill a dataset of policies into a single generative model over policy parameters. We show that our method achieves a compression ratio of 13x while recovering 98% of the original rewards and 89% of the original coverage. Furthermore, the conditioning mechanism of diffusion models allows for flexibly selecting and sequencing behaviors using language.

  paper:
    summary:  We leverage graph hyper networks to learn graph hyper policies trained with off-policy reinforcement learning resulting in networks that are two orders of magnitude smaller than commonly used networks yet encode policies comparable to those encoded by much larger networks trained on the same task.

  paper:
    summary: In this work, we focus on the combination of analytical and learning-based techniques to help researchers solve challenging robot locomotion problems. Specifically, we explore the combination of curricular trajectory optimization (CTO) and deep reinforcement learning (RL) for quadruped hurdling tasks.

  paper:
    summary: We introduce a new version of VizDoom simulator to create a highly efficient learning environment that provides raw audio observations. We study the performance of different model architectures in a series of tasks that require the agent to recognize sounds and execute instructions given in natural language. Finally, we train our agent to play the full game of Doom and find that it can consistently defeat a traditional vision-based adversary.

    summary:  This paper evaluates the use of DDPG to solve the problem of risk aware portfolio construction. Simulations are done on a portfolio of twenty stocks and the use of both Rate of Return and Sortino ratio as a measure of portfolio performance are evaluated. Results are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of DDPG for risk aware portfolio construction.
