- title: Efficiently Learning Small Policies for Locomotion and Manipulation
  publishedIn:
    name: (Submitted to ICRA23)
    # date: 7 June 2020

  paper:
    summary:  We leverage graph hyper networks to learn graph hyper policies trained with off-policy reinforcement learning resulting in networks that are two orders of magnitude smaller than commonly used networks yet encode policies comparable to those encoded by much larger networks trained on the same task.

  paper:
    summary: In this work, we focus on the combination of analytical and learning-based techniques to help researchers solve challenging robot locomotion problems. Specifically, we explore the combination of curricular trajectory optimization (CTO) and deep reinforcement learning (RL) for quadruped hurdling tasks.

  paper:
    summary: We introduce a new version of VizDoom simulator to create a highly efficient learning environment that provides raw audio observations. We study the performance of different model architectures in a series of tasks that require the agent to recognize sounds and execute instructions given in natural language. Finally, we train our agent to play the full game of Doom and find that it can consistently defeat a traditional vision-based adversary.

  paper:
    summary:  We present RANDPOL, a generalized policy iteration algorithm for MDPs with continuous state and action spaces. Both the policy and value functions are represented with randomized networks. We also give finite time guarantees on the performance of the algorithm.

  paper:
    summary:  This paper evaluates the use of DDPG to solve the problem of risk aware portfolio construction. Simulations are done on a portfolio of twenty stocks and the use of both Rate of Return and Sortino ratio as a measure of portfolio performance are evaluated. Results are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of DDPG for risk aware portfolio construction.
